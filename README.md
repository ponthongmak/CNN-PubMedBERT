ICD-10 codes prediction from discharge summaries using Deep Learning

This repositary stored python source codes for my research, which is a part of my thesis entitled "DIAGNOSIS (ICD-10) PREDICTION FROM DISCHARGE SUMMARY BY DEEP LEARNING". The main purpose for source code sharing is to promote the reproducibility and transparency of the research.

The datasets are not able to share due to the Ethic.
