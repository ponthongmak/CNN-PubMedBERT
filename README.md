# CNN-PubMedBERT
ICD-10 codes prediction from discharge summaries using Deep Learning

# Objectives
This repositary stored python source codes for my research, which is a part of my thesis entitled "DIAGNOSIS (ICD-10) PREDICTION FROM DISCHARGE SUMMARY BY DEEP LEARNING". The main purpose for source code sharing is to promote the reproducibility and transparency of the research.

# Datasets
Our study using two datasets, including 
1) discharge summaries from Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand, contained 15,329 discharge summaries. The data could not be shared due to reseach ethic, 
2) discharge summaries from MIMIC-III data version 1.4. The public dataset, which required license to access.
